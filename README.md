# üå± Projects
Here are some of my recent projects that showcase my skills and expertise:

## Forcast Forex With Deep Learning Models
This project uses deep learning models, such as Recurrent neural network (RNN) and Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated recurrent unit (GRU), to forecast forex prices. The models are trained on historical forex data and are capable of predicting future prices with high accuracy. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/MahdiNavaei/Forcast-Forex-With-Deep-Learning-Models) for more information.

## Books Recommendation System
In this project, I developed a recommendation system for books using collaborative filtering and content-based filtering techniques. The system recommends books to users based on their reading history and preferences. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/MahdiNavaei/Books-Recommendation-System) for more information.

## Stock Price Collection
This project collects historical stock price data from the Yahoo Finance website and stores it in a database for further analysis. The collected data can be used to train machine learning models for stock price prediction. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/MahdiNavaei/Stock-price-collection) for more information.

## CIFAR-10 Image Classification
In this project, I built a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The model achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test set. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/MahdiNavaei/CIFAR-10-Image-Classification) for more information.

## Cat vs Dog Classifier
This project uses deep learning techniques to classify images of cats and dogs. I built a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model that achieved an accuracy of over 90% on the test set. Check out the [repository](https://github.com/MahdiNavaei/Cat_Dog_Classifier) for more information.

## Customer Personality Analysis for Marketing
This project involves a detailed analysis of a company‚Äôs ideal customers using customer personality analysis. The analysis helps a business better understand its customers and modify its products according to the specific needs, behaviors, and concerns of different types of customers. The project demonstrates how customer personality analysis can be used to target specific customer segments for marketing purposes.
